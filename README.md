## More Info.

I have made slides using MD multiple times.
This is the first time I use mdpress.
This tools is great!

## Problems

   * The slides transformation is not correct.
   I set all transformations to be horizontal sliding in the source.
   Not work.

## Fair use of 3rd party materials

To save time, I dumped my `wget` history in `references.md`.
You can find the sources to 3rd party materials there.
